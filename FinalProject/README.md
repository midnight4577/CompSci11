This is a simple implementation of a 2D ballistics calculator that includes resistance due to fluid

Features:
-Allows complete customization of all ballistic variables (mass, drag coefficent, cross sectional area, fluid density) /n
-Allows customization of most simulation variables (gravity, velocity, angle, time step, y-stop)
